# Weekly_Projects

This repo keeps track of any projects developed or worked at weekly ResBazAZ meetings: PhTea, Hacky Hour, and Shut Up And Write.

### How to document a meeting?

We document our meetings by following a Jupyter Notebook tempate (`notebook_template.ipynb`). Thus, in order to create or update a notebook for any meeting, you will need `Python` and `Jupyter Notebook`.

1.  Fork this repository 
2.  `cd` into `notebooks` directory
3.  Next start jupyter notebook by typing the command `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. This should open a window in your web browser on your `localhost`
4. Select the box next to `notebook_template.ipynb` and make a copy of this notebook. 
5. Click on the copy you have made to open this notebook
6. Rename the notebook! Follow the naming convention in the first cell of the template (e.g. `2017-08-03-hackyhour.ipynb`).
7. Nota Bene: Even though this is a `Python` notebook, all of the cells are in `Markdown`. 
8. Enter in whatever information, attendence, notes, etc that you would like to publish in the notebook.
9. When you are done, save the notebook and exit jupyter notebooks (control+c).
10. Commit and push your changes to your fork `git add <notebook name>`, `git commit <your commit message>`, `git push`.
11. Now you are ready to make a pull request so that we can merge your changes into the `resbazaz` repo. Go [here](https://github.com/resbazaz/Weekly_Projects/pulls) to make a pull request. Make sure to compare `resbazaz/Weekly_Projects`'s `origin` branch to your repo.
12. Add a quick comment on the pull request and submit. Someone will review your code and merge it into `master`.
13. Congratulations! :tada: You have contributed to ResBazAZ! Thank you for your help! :sparkling_heart:
